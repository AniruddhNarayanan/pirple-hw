“let” and “const” are both place holders like variables, but unlike variables “let” and “const” are block based scope, so if you declare either  “let”, or “const” in an “if” statement then you can only use it inside of the “if” statement. The difference between “let”, and “const” is that the value assigned to let can still be changed, whereas the value assigned to “const” cannot be changed.
